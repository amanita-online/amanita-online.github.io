Earlier this week, Corey, a 33-year-old in New Zealand, was hiking through the woods when he happened upon a familiar [toadstool](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-legend-of-toad). It was bright red with little white specs, the very funghi he once forced his favorite [pixelated Italian plumber](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/most-plumbers-dont-give-a-shit-that-mario-is-no-longer-a-plumber-but-some-really-really-do) to ingest so that he would grow much, much larger. 

Officially called *Amanita muscaria* (and sometimes “[fly agaric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria)”), it was also the kind of shroom the [Smurfs lived in](http://m2jlstudio.com/images/MJSKETCHBOOK/2013/SB-Mushroom.011.jpg), [Alice hallucinated from in *Alice in Wonderland*](https://curthendrix.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/alice-in-wonderland-lewis-carolls-imagination-or-mushrooms/) and [a proto-Santa used for a whole different kind of trip around the world](https://inhabitat.com/santa-and-the-shrooms-the-real-story-behind-the-design-of-christmas/#:~:text=really intense 'shrooms.-,On the night of the winter solstice%2C a Koryak shaman,to all the village's problems). To say nothing of [its role in myriad religious ceremonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria#In_religion) dating back to 1500 B.C.

The Mario Mushroom, aka Amanita muscaria

In other words, how could Corey not give it a try, joining all  the shamans and Smurfs who came before him in experiencing Amanita  muscaria’s transcendent powers?

That’s the thing about Amanita muscaria: [Mycologists seem to constantly argue](http://bayareamushrooms.org/education/further_reflections_amanita_muscaria.html) over whether its benefits outweigh the trouble it brings. And that  trouble is far more serious than a bout of diarrhea. “These red boiz can be pretty painful,” Corey explains. “[They can cause intense euphoria and drowsiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmanitaMuscaria/comments/gzmpt7/most_profound_experience_ive_had_in_a_while/), but they can also cause vomiting, stomach cramps, uncontrolled muscle twitching, nausea, confusion, paranoia and amnesia.” 

After all, Amanita muscaria *is* a poisonous mushroom. Worse yet, it closely resembles its deadlier relatives, the aptly named [death cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_phalloides) and [destroying angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroying_angel). “It’s undoubtedly dangerous in large or even moderate amounts,” mycologist David Arora writes in his book [*Mushrooms Demystified*](https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0/page/282/mode/2up). “The effects vary from person to person, mushroom to mushroom, and from region to region and season to season, so that there is no way to  determine in advance what one’s reaction will be.” 

That reaction allegedly includes death, but the [North American Mycological Association](https://namyco.org/mushroom_poisoning_syndromes.php) argues that the mushroom has been wrongfully accused, writing on its website that there are “no reliably documented cases of death from toxins in these mushrooms in the past 100 years.” Moreover, Arora says the [mushroom’s reputation has swung so far into the danger zone](http://davidarora.com/uploads/rubel_arora_muscaria_revised.pdf) that its benefits have started to become obscured, especially if you properly detoxify it and don’t overdo the dosage. 

To that end, YouTuber “A.D.,” short for the name of her channel, [Amanita Dreamer](https://www.youtube.com/c/AmanitaDreamer/featured), is among Amanita muscaria’s most ardent defenders. After a lifetime of  crippling anxiety and daily panic attacks, she found herself in a  decade-long struggle to wean off of benzodiazepines. “The pain from my  nervous system, not to mention the major panic attacks that ensued every time I’d start to taper down, made life not worth living,” she tells  me. “So I decided to end my life. I got my affairs in order, made my  will, said my goodbyes and waited for the right moment.” 

During that wait, though, she happened upon a “giant, red,  almost glowing mushroom.” It piqued her interest, but after an initial  round of research abouthttps://merryjane.com/culture/wtf-is-an-amanita-muscaria-mushroom-and-does-it-get-you-high its more poisonous qualities, she shrugged it  off. Still, she says, “[The mushroom kept appearing](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/first-mom-and-dad-got-into-weed-now-its-shrooms) in my dreams. As I walked around in different areas of my neighborhood, I kept seeing it. I thought I was going nuts, I was really thinking,  ‘Boy, my cheese has slid off the cracker here!’” 

To ensure that the cheese stayed atop the cracker, she did a  bit more research and discovered how to detoxify the mushroom. In short, the poison in Amanita muscaria is mostly due to [a chemical called ibotenic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibotenic_acid). People who regularly eat the mushrooms [might argue over the means](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/mushroom-drug-urine-high) and how much ibotenic acid needs to be extracted, but most stick to simply [boiling them in water for 20 minutes](https://honest-food.net/eating-santas-shroom/) to get enough of the acid out to avoid nausea and gastrointestinal distress.

Better yet, because [Amanita muscaria is legal in every state save for Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_psychoactive_Amanita_mushrooms), most vendors will do the extraction for you — though A.D. says it’s  worthwhile to boil or dehydrate them again for good measure. 

The first time she tried the mushroom, A.D. tells me she “[tripped balls](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/high-tripping-balls-phrase-origin),” but by the next morning, she says, “For the first time in my entire  life, I woke up with no anxiety, no nerve pain. Suddenly I didn’t want  to leave the planet. I haven’t taken a single benzo since.” 

Today, she microdoses about one-eighth of a teaspoon every two  weeks and spends the rest of her time advocating on Amanita muscaria’s  behalf (hence her YouTube channel). “First of all, we need to stop  comparing it to psilocybin, because it’s a completely different  species,” she explains. “Talking about Amanita [like it’s a psilocybin](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/should-everyone-trip-balls-at-least-once-in-their-lifetime) is like comparing humans to fish, they’re just not the same.” 

Along these lines, Bran, a 32-year-old biologist in Alaska,  believes 2020 is primed to be Amanita muscaria’s breakout party.  “Amanita isn’t as viciously ihttps://merryjane.com/culture/wtf-is-an-amanita-muscaria-mushroom-and-does-it-get-you-highntrospective as serotonin-predominant  psychedelics and is effective at producing inner quiet with heightened  awareness of subconscious emotional rhythms, a kind of ‘psychedelic [ketamine](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/ketamine-could-be-the-new-depression-treatment-of-choice-2),’ if you will,” he tells me, adding that he currently has “hundreds of  Amanita muscaria caps,” waiting to be ground up, homogenized and  microdosed.Amanita muscaria Bran recently found in the wild

“Ketamine has gained popularity in recent years because people  want an escape from their inner angst,” Bran continues, “so I think  there’s an opening for Amanita in drug use culture, too.” 

Corey is definitely on board. “As much of a literal pain in the ass it was both in stomach cramps and shitting my pants, I’d do it  again,” he explains. “It was a spiritual journey. I was asleep, but my  mind was awake in another reality. I’d like to try again and consume  them properly with a more experienced person.” 

Unfortunately for him, though, Amanita muscaria is illegal in  New Zealand. So much like Mario fervently maneuvering through the  mushroom kingdom, Corey says he’ll “have to wait until I find one of  these bad boys in the wild again.”

# WTF Is an Amanita Muscaria Mushroom and Does It Get You High?

------

When most people hear the term “magic mushrooms,” they immediately think of  psilocybin, a family of fungi that produce the hallucinogenic compounds  psilocin and psilocybin. Another mushroom, however, also has strong [psychedelic properties](https://merryjane.com/culture/what-is-lsd-and-how-does-this-drug-affect-the-mind) and a history of human use going back thousands of years. Known as *Amanita muscaria* and by its common name, fly agaric, the mushroom is deeply rooted in  the shamanic traditions of the Northern Hemisphere. In fact, much of the lore behind the jolly old Christmas elf, Santa Claus, can be traced to  the ritual use of this whimsical fungus.

Yes, that's right. The tale of the flying reindeer that tow a sleigh  for a large man who shoves himself down chimnies to steal cookies, and  leave presents for good children and clumps of cole for those who  misbehave, was conceived by the magic of the *Amanita* mushroom. How's that for the basis of a religious holiday?

***What is Amanita Muscaria?***

*Amanita muscaria* is a mushroom that can be found growing in  forests throughout much of Europe, Asia, and North America. The easily  recognized species has a white-flecked red cap with white gills, and  sits on a white stem. The fungus grows at the base of many species of  trees, living in harmony with the roots of the trees in an underground  symbiotic soil community. When the fruiting body first emerges from the  earth, it is covered with a white film that breaks and separates into  spots as the mushroom grows, revealing the bright red hue beneath. A  prolonged or particularly strong rain can sometimes wash away the  resulting signature white spots completely. 

*Amanita muscaria* contains the hallucinogenic compounds ibotenic acid and muscimol. Although mushroom collecting field guides commonly list *Amanita muscaria* as poisonous, only a few confirmed fatalities have been caused by the  species. However, amanitas are easily confused with a related — but  deadly — species that look similar to them, so leave the wild mushroom  foraging to the [experts and mycologists](https://merryjane.com/culture/a-mushroom-foraging-adventure-with-the-fungus-fairy).

***History of*** **Amanita muscaria**

The *Amanita muscaria* mushroom has a long tradition of  entheogenic use in many early cultures of Northern Europe and Central  Asia. The ritual use of the species spread to North America from Siberia during Ice Age migrations across the Bering Straits. However, the use  of *Amanita muscaria* in the New World did not become widespread  among early American cultures due to the existence of the more popular  and potent psilocybin varieties.

In Northern Europe, *Amanita muscaria* has a rich history in  shamanic traditions. The US Forest Service notes that pre-Christian  cultures of the region incorporated it into their celebrations of Winter Solstice. The brightly colored mushrooms would appear at the base of  trees including fir and spruce in the weeks leading up the seasonal  celebration and were collected for use in holiday rituals.

“In central Asia, shamans wore special garments to collect the fly agaric mushrooms,” the Forest Service [writes](https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/ethnobotany/Mind_and_Spirit/flyagaric.shtml). “Their coats and pants were red with the collar and cuffs trimmed with  white fur and topped off with black boots. The shaman collected the fly  agaric mushrooms in a special sack. After collecting the mushrooms, the  shaman would return to his village and enter the yurt (a portable tent  dwelling) through the smoke hole on the roof.”

The parallels to Santa Claus are unmistakable, and *Amanita muscaria* has permeated other aspects of Christmas lore, as well. The mushroom’s  likeness has been used as a Christmas ornament, on greeting cards, and  in other holiday imagery in Europe for generations. Even reindeer are  associated with *Amanita muscaria*, the effects of which are rumored to bestow the gift of flight to the animals.

***Amanita Muscaria’s Effects***

Of course, Amanita muscaria won’t really make you fly, but it can definitely inspire a good trip. When taken, the ibotenic acid [decarboxylates](https://merryjane.com/culture/so-wtf-is-decarbing-weed-and-why-should-you-care) into muscimol, the compound responsible for the psychedelic effects of the mushroom. The high induced by *Amantia muscaria* is different from other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://merryjane.com/culture/how-to-take-lsd-so-your-first-acid-trip-goes-as-smooth-as-possible), [psilocybin](https://merryjane.com/culture/can-you-smoke-magic-mushrooms), and mescaline and can sometimes be unpredictable. 

Users of *Amanita muscaria* have reported experiencing  feelings of euphoria and tranquility, an altered sense of hearing and  taste, and vivid changes in visual or sensory perception. Side effects  include sweating, involuntary movements known as ataxia, dilated pupils, nausea, a loss of balance or coordination, drowsiness, and excessive  salivation. The effects generally become noticeable 30 to 90 minutes  after taking *Amanita muscaria* and will last between four to 10 hours.

***How to Take Amanita Muscaria***

Amanita muscaria is generally taken after the mushrooms have been  dried. Drying allows much of the ibotenic acid in the mushrooms to  convert to muscimol, greatly increasing the potency. The dried mushrooms can be eaten as they are or they can also be parboiled before eating or simmered in water for 30 to 60 minutes. Once simmered, the water can be consumed with the mushrooms for a stronger effect or discarded, if  desired. This is also how one would make tea, but you should strain out  the mushroom particles with a strainer or cheesecloth. Mixing ginger,  lemon, and honey into the tea will also help keep the nausea to a  minimum. 

One small mushroom cap or less than 5 grams can be considered a good starting dose for a beginner trying *Amantia muscaria* for the first time. One to three medium caps, or 5-10 grams, will  invoke a medium effect, while higher doses of three to six mid-sized  caps (10-30 grams) should result in a strong trip.

*Amanita muscaria* has the potential to induce a strong  psychedelic effect that some say was an inspiration for Alice’s trip  "beyond the looking glass." Because of their potency and the possibility of unwanted side effects, they should be taken with care. So, be sure  to start low and slow, and make sure you are in comfortable surroundings with people you trust!

***Amanita muscaria*** (also known as **fly agaric** or **fly amanita**) is a psychoactive mushroom that grows widely in the northern  hemisphere. The fly agaric is a large white-gilled, white-spotted,  usually red mushroom that is one of the most recognizable and widely  encountered in popular culture.[*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, which derive from its primary psychoactive constituents [ibotenic acid](https://psychonautwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Ibotenic_acid&action=edit&redlink=1) and [muscimol](https://psychonautwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Muscimol&action=edit&redlink=1). Muscimol is a potent, selective agonist for the [GABAA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) that produces [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedative), [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) and [deliriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) effects.[[1\]](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychonautwiki.org%2Fwiki%2FAmanita_muscaria#cite_note-1)

Although classified as poisonous, reports of human deaths  resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboiling—which  weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom's psychoactive  substances[[2\]](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychonautwiki.org%2Fwiki%2FAmanita_muscaria#cite_note-2)—it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America.[*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

*Amanita muscaria* has been used as an intoxicant and  entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. In western Siberia, the use of A. muscaria was  restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state. In eastern Siberia, A. muscaria was used by both  shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as  religiously.[[3\]](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychonautwiki.org%2Fwiki%2FAmanita_muscaria#cite_note-3)

There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of  this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East,  Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.[*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] 

In remote areas of Lithuania, Amanita muscaria has been reported  to be consumed at wedding feasts. The Lithuanians have also been  reported to export the mushrooms to the Lapps in the Far North for use  in shamanic rituals.[[4\]](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychonautwiki.org%2Fwiki%2FAmanita_muscaria#cite_note-4)

*Amanita muscaria* is sometimes confused with [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) as "magic mushrooms". However, these two mushrooms have completely  different active compounds, pharmacological effects, and appearances.

## Habitat

Amanita muscaria has formed a symbiotic relationship with various  coniferous and deciduous trees such as birches, pines, and spruces, and  can often be found growing near them. There are many different varieties of amanita muscaria with varying appearances.[[5\]](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychonautwiki.org%2Fwiki%2FAmanita_muscaria#cite_note-fuhrer-5)

## Chemistry

[![img](https://psychonautwiki.org/w/thumb.php?f=Muscimol.svg&width=250)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/File:Muscimol.svg)

Muscimol, the primary psychoactive constituent in *Amanita muscaria*.

The principle psychoactive compounds in amanita muscaria are [muscimol](https://psychonautwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Muscimol&action=edit&redlink=1) and the related compound ibotenic acid. Both compounds have similar  molecular structures; however, ibotenic acid contains a carboxyl group.  Both compounds contain an isoxazole ring with a hydroxyl group bonded at the 3-position. Unlike muscimol, ibotenic acid is a non-selective  glutamate receptor agonist, which contributes to its relatively powerful neurotoxic effects. Ibotenic acid is also decarboxylated to muscimol.

Amanita muscaria also contains small amounts of muscarine, a non-selective muscarinic [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist). While this was once thought to be the principle mechanism of action of  amanita muscaria, it is no longer thought to be since the levels of  muscarine are too low to be significant.

## Pharmacology

[![img](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/White_Fly-Agaric_mature.jpg/250px-White_Fly-Agaric_mature.jpg)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/File:White_Fly-Agaric_mature.jpg)

*Amanita muscaria* var *alba*. Some varieties of A. muscaria can be confused with poisonous ones.

Muscimol has an atypical mechanism of action. Unlike classical [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) (which are 5-HT2A agonists) and classical [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) (which are [NMDA receptor antagonists](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist)), muscimol is a potent GABAA [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist), meaning it activates the receptor for [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA), the brain's principle inhibitory neurotransmitter. As an agonist, muscimol binds to the same site on the GABAA receptor as GABA itself. This is unlike [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) and barbiturates, which bind to different allosteric sites on the GABAA receptor. 

Muscimol has also been shown to be a partial agonist at the GABAA-ρ receptor, which may contribute to its psychoactive effects. Some substances that interact with the GABAA receptor such as [zolpidem](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Zolpidem) have been shown to also have hallucinogenic effects.

Ibotenic acid has been shown to be a potent NMDA agonist as well  as a powerful agonist at the group I and group II metabotropic glutamate receptors. Due to in vivo decarboxylation, ibotenic acid is metabolized to muscimol and thus has many similar pharmacological characteristics.

### Toxicity and harm potential

The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) of muscimol in rat is 45mg/kg orally and in mice is 20mg/kg orally.[[6\]](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychonautwiki.org%2Fwiki%2FAmanita_muscaria#cite_note-6)

## Subjective effects

**Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [***Subjective Effect Index***](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) (**SEI**), a research literature based on anecdotal reports and the personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers). As a result, they should be regarded with a healthy degree of  skepticism. It is worth noting that these effects will not necessarily  occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are  more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become much more likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, serious injury, or death.***

## Toxicity and harm potential

Since muscimol and ibotenic acid are GABAA agonists, it may be harmful to combine it with other [GABAergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) such as [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) or barbiturates. Ibotenic acid is also known to be a neurotoxin, acting via the NMDA receptor and metabotropic glutamate receptor. It is wise  to dry amanita muscarias in the oven or purchase pre-dried amanitas to  ensure the ibotenic acid concentration is as low as possible. 

One of the major dangers of amanita muscaria is misidentifying it as a different species of mushroom. Several other mushrooms in the  genus amanita are toxic. One such mushroom, the amanita phalloides,  better known as the death cap, contains α-amanitin and β-Amanitin, both  of which are extremely potent RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III  inhibitors which damage virtually every tissue in the body. As the name  suggests, the amanita muscaria contains the chemical muscarine, a  muscarinic acetylcholine agonist which is known to cause seizures;  however, the mushroom contains very low amounts that are highly unlikely to pose any significant harm.

Amanita muscaria mushrooms are not known to be addictive or  dependence-forming, and reports even show that desire to redose goes  down with usage, though there is no research on this topic.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

## Legal status

Amanita muscaria grows naturally and is legal to grow, sell and  consume in most parts of the world. It is, however, restricted in some  countries.

-   **Australia:** The [muscimol](https://psychonautwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Muscimol&action=edit&redlink=1) present in amanita muscaria is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited  substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015).[[7\]](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychonautwiki.org%2Fwiki%2FAmanita_muscaria#cite_note-Poisons_Standard-7) A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused  and the manufacture, possession, sale or use of is prohibited by law  except when required for medical or scientific research, or for  analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth  and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.[[7\]](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychonautwiki.org%2Fwiki%2FAmanita_muscaria#cite_note-Poisons_Standard-7)
-   **Netherlands:** Amanita muscaria and amanita pantherina are  illegal to buy, sell, or possess since December 2008. Possession of  amounts larger than 0.5 g dried or 5 g fresh lead to a criminal charge.[[8\]](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychonautwiki.org%2Fwiki%2FAmanita_muscaria#cite_note-8)
-   **United Kingdom:** It is illegal to produce, supply, or import  this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect  on May 26th, 2016.[[9\]](about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpsychonautwiki.org%2Fwiki%2FAmanita_muscaria#cite_note-9)
